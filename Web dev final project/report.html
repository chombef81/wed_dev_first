          The site is a made up organisation called Junior Code Academy.<br />
          The organisation is a charity that aims to teach young people how to
          code. It aims to work with other charity organisations like Respberry
          Pi to improve and develop better ways of getting young people involed
          in teach in positive way and at the same provide opportunities for
          this young people to break through into teach.<br />
          The front page is made up of tiles that have a little about the
          defferent programs on offer. I have done this so as to attact visiters
          to the site to the articals. I have create a blog style to the
          articles and made the short in order to not have to much to read when
          young people visit.

        <b>Inspiration:</b>

        <p>
          The first site I took Inspiration from is Raspberry Pi. I even put
          them on my site. The programming ages and packages that are
          recommanded on my site where take from Raspberry Pi. <br />
          I have also take insparation from scratch as a tool and as a website.
          I use scratch with my son and am to try and teach him how good coding
          is for his education. <br />
          More insparation came from videos on youtube which helped me
          understand extra concepts and helped me to make the webpage a little
          more intaractive than I would have otherwise done. Leasing to podcast
          like coding newbie and lady bugs helped keep me motivated.

        <p>
          I tried not to use too many colours on the page, I also used white for
          my articals on a dark back ground in order to make it easier for the
          words to be seen. I used bigger font than the defult font as well.
          <br />
          I did not use any animations with lots of flashing as that tends to
          trouble people with epilepsy.<br />
          Using the correct tags helps with speach software.

          >state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How
          did you achieve that?</i
        >
        <p>
          I had to learn the css before and after elements in order to create
          some of the animations on the site. I used w3school site to reasearch
          how to impleteent this.<br />
          when I was doing the responsive element of the website I had to
          research and learn how to ensure that the images I used responed to
          the site without over following. I learned that this could be done byt
          using % sizing rather than actual sizing in CSS <br/ > I also learned
          how to target multipule classes using the [class*="classname"]. This
          reduced the amout of copy past I had to do and ensure the amount of
          code was less.<br />
          I also learned how to use my UI more effectiveley to make the coding
          expirience better, and adding files to GIT meant to I could keep track
          of changes as well as revert without too much trouble.

        <b>Evaluation I:</b>
        <i>
          What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful?
          Why?</i
        >
        <p>
          The logo fit in to the site really well and from that I was able to
          come up with the colours of the site. I also feel the animations for
          my link are good as the are not over the top but are good enought to
          catch someones attention. <br />
          I think the back ground on the page is interesting but does not
          distract from the message on the site. I worked had on the
          responsivenes of the site and I am happy with how the site transforms
          at every stage as the page gets smaller or even when you use a large
          34inch wide screen monitor.

        <b>Evaluation II:</b>
        <i
          >What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things
          differently another time?</i
        >
        <p>
          As it stand my project is not as complete as I would liked it to be.
          This is because of family and work commitments. I also think that the
          site is blan and could do with an uplift which I could have done had I
          had time. I have done the best I could to showcase the different
          aspects of HTML CSS and JS that I have leant. <br />
          Though using CSS grid was the easiest way to arrange my site I would
          have liked to expore the use of flex boxes.<br />
          I am also aware that I did not use CSS packages like bootstrape, but I
          feel that using pages I only learn the pacage but not how to code
          correctley.

        <p>
          For my wire frame I used pages for Mac. This was a very easy software
          to use in order to visiualise the site I wanted to produce. <br />
          The use of youtube can not be under estimated as there is so much
          information on the to help on any aspect of web development. <br />
          Of course the UI I use is VS code, with add on like emmit to help
          making the code expirience esier.
