          <b>Scratch</b> is a high-level block-based visual programming language
          and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool for
          programming, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16. Users on the
          site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the website using a
          block-like interface. Projects can be exported to HTML5, JavaScript,
          Android apps and EXE files using external tools. The service is
          developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+
          languages, and is used in most parts of the world. Scratch is taught
          and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as
          other public knowledge institutions. As of May 8, 2022, community
          statistics on the language's official website show more than 104
          million projects shared by over 90 million users, over 686 million
          total projects ever created (including unshared projects), and more
          than 100 million monthly website visits.

          The Scratch interface is divided into three main sections: a stage
          area, block palette, and a coding area to place and arrange the blocks
          into scripts that can be run by pressing the green flag or clicking on
          the code itself. Users may also create their own code blocks and they
          will appear in "My Blocks". The stage area features the results (e.g.,
          animations, turtle graphics, either in a small or normal size, with a
          full-screen option also available) and all sprites thumbnails being
          listed in the bottom area. The stage uses x and y coordinates, with
          0,0 being the stage center. A program to change the background and
          make a character speak, when clicked With a sprite selected at the
          bottom of the staging area, blocks of commands can be applied to it by
          dragging them from the block palette into the coding area. The
          Costumes tab allows users to change the look of the sprite with a
          vector and bitmap editor in order to create various effects, including
          animation. The Sounds tab allows attaching sounds and music to a
          sprite. When creating sprites and also backgrounds, users can draw
          their own sprite manually, choose a Sprite from the library, or upload
          an image.
